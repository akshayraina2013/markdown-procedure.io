## Introduction
**Meditation** is a practice where an individual uses a technique – such as mindfulness, or focusing their mind on a particular object, thought or activity – to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state.

## Step-by-step procedure to meditate

 1. **Get settled.** Find a quiet space where you can relax. Sit comfortably in a chair with your hands resting in your lap or on your knees. Keep your back straight.
 2. **Breathe deeply.** Defocus your eyes, gazing softly into the middle distance. Take five deep, audible breaths, breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth.
 3. **Check in.** Take a few moments to settle into your body. Gently observe your posture, and notice the sensations where your body touches the chair and your feet meet the ground.
 4. **Scan your body.** Slowly turn your mind inwards. Scan your body from head to toe, observing any tension or discomfort. Don’t try to change what you find, simply take note of it. Scan again, although this time notice which parts of the body feel relaxed.
 5. **Consider the purpose** Pause for around 30 seconds and consider the purpose why you’re sitting today. Recognise any expectation or desire you’ve brought along, and let it go.
 6. **Observe the breath.** Bring your attention to your breathing. Don’t make any effort to change it, just observe the rising and falling sensation that it creates in your body.
 7. **Allow your mind to be free** Spend 20-30 seconds just sitting. You might find yourself inundated with thoughts and plans, or feel calm and focused.
 8. **Prepare to finish** Become aware once more of the physical feelings: of the chair beneath you, where your feet make contact with the floor, your arms and your hands resting in your lap.
 9. **Take it with you** Before standing up, form a clear idea about what you’re going to do next, like brushing your teeth, making a cup of tea or getting your keys to leave the house.
